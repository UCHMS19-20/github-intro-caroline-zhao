# What I Know About Git
by Caroline Zhao
* It's a *version control* system
* Version control helps people keep track of files and the changelog
* Some terminology involved includes: **branches**, **snapshots**, **commits**, etc
* A main feature of Git is the **repository**
* You can make a remote repository localized with the *clone* function
* There will **always** be a *README.md* or *README.txt* file in the repo
* README files used to be more relevant when it was harder to install programs
* The .md stands for *markdown*
* Markdown is a form of plain text that will later be displayed with certain formatting standards
